# GlobalUsage-lang-mod
A modification of the [GlobalUsage extension](https://github.com/mediawiki/mediawiki-trunk-extensions/tree/master/GlobalUsage) for MediaWiki that was hacked together to make it work on certain wiki families running MediaWiki 1.17.

## Dirty Hack
Be warned, this stuff is not pretty. This modification relies on each wiki in the family having a different language code set for it. Is this elegant? No. Is this prone to breakage? Yes. Do you still have to run maintenance scripts on each wiki in the farm? Yes. Does it work? Sometimes.
